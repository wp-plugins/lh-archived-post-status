== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Isn't this the same as using the Draft or Private statuses? =

Actually, no, they are not the same thing.

The Draft status is a "pre-published" status that is reserved for content that is still being worked on. You can still make changes to content marked as Draft, and you can preview your changes.

The Private status is a special kind of published status. It means the content is only available to certain logged in users.

The Archived post status, on the other hand, is meant to be a "post-published" status. Once a post has been set to Archived the content is either hidden entirely from non logged in viewers or removed from the front page and feed (but still available on singular pages). This behaviour is controlled in the settings screen.

= Doesn't this do the same thing as the other archiving plugin in the repository? =

Actually it does more! Unlike the other plugin content archived with this plugin can still be available to non logged in visitors (depends on plugin settings) and just  removed from the front page and xml feeds (with a custom message can also be added to flag to visitors that the content is no longer up too date). Alternately it can be hidden entirely (to non logged in viewers).

= Can't I just trash old content I don't want anymore? =

Yes, there is nothing wrong with trashing old content. However it will be hidden from non logged in viewers.

However, WordPress automatically purges trashed posts every 7 days (by default), so it wil be gone.

This is what makes the Archived post status handy. You can unpublish content without having to delete it forever.

= Can I exclude the Archived status from appearing on certain post types? =

Yes, you can do this in the settings area, just select the post types that you want to be able to archive.
